# CHORD
CHORD is an active management technique for routers in the wired networks. It is a stateless AQM protocol based on RED and improves the idea of packet matching from CHOKe. It ensures better fairness among different responsive and unresponsive flows while keeping high throughput and less queue delay. CHORD performs multiple comparisons and the drawing factor depends upon the average queue size. It also maintains the history of recently dropped packets and uses this history to penalize unresponsive flows.
